                <p>Wild School Experience is a company founded by Sandra Schleier, an environmentalist with a passion for <span class="highlight">scientific education</span>. 
                    Our mission is to inspire the next generation to appreciate and protect our natural world through immersive, hands-on learning experiences in one of the 
                    most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet—<span class="highlight">El Yunque Rainforest.</span></p>
                <p>With over a decade of experience in <span class="highlight">Marine Biology and Environmental Science</span>, Sandra brings a wealth of knowledge and a deep
                     commitment to conservation education. Her expertise and enthusiasm have made Wild School Experience a trusted name among educators and nature enthusiasts 
                     alike.</p>
                <p>We believe that learning extends beyond the classroom, and by exploring the natural world, students can develop a lifelong connection with the environment.
                     Whether it’s observing nocturnal wildlife or studying the complex ecosystems within the forest, our experiences are designed to ignite curiosity and foster 
                     a sense of responsibility toward the environment.</p>
