                <p>We offer a variety of <span class="highlight">educational tours</span> tailored specifically for middle and high school students. Our tours are an excellent opportunity for students to step 
                    out of their comfort zones and engage with nature in a way that is both educational and adventurous.</p>
                <p>Our signature service is the <span class="highlight">Nighttime Rainforest Exploration</span>, where students can experience the unique ecosystem of the only Tropical Rainforest in the U.S. 
                    Forest System under the cover of darkness. Guided by Sandra Schleier, students will learn about the nocturnal habits of rainforest creatures, the importance 
                    of biodiversity, and the ecological significance of the rainforest.</p>
                <p>In addition to our rainforest tours, we also offer custom <span class="highlight">educational programs</span> that align with school curricula, focusing on topics such as ecology, 
                    conservation, and the impacts of climate change on tropical ecosystems. Each program is designed to be interactive, engaging, and informative, ensuring that
                     students leave with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the environment.</p>
                <p>Our tours are available year-round, rain or shine, and are suitable for students of all ages. We also accommodate school groups, scout troops, and other 
                    educational organizations looking for a unique outdoor learning experience.</p>
